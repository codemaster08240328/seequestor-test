# Coding Test

Build a simple web application that renders a series of articles along with info about the author and comments. You can find sample data in `data.json`, however keep in mind this needs to scale to a much larger dataset. If you're applying for a full stack position and/or want to show off your back end skills as well, also build a simple Node server to serve the data, otherwise you can just bundle the data with the UI code.

* You **must** use JavaScript and React
* The solution **should** seamlessly scale to millions of records
* You **can** use any other technology you like
* Make it yours - you can write unit tests, documentation, build fancy graphics, use animations etc - anything you like
* There is no time limit, however we expect to get something back within a few days
